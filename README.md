# Mentored Project Week 1 Homework - Git and JavaScript

## Instructions

### Submitting the Homework

Your submissions will be done through git. We'll automatically run tests against each git commit - you can see the results
of the tests by clicking on the checkmarks in your GitHub commit list. To commit and push your work to GitHub, do
```
git commit -am "<YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE>"
```
and then
```
git push
```

If you don't want to wait for the autograder to see if your code works, you can run the tests manually with `python -m unittest test`.

## Homework Questions

Welcome to the mentored project! This week's homework is just to get you familiar with using command line tools like git and
to get you used to reading other people's documentation and code. The questions you need to complete are short and simple.

### Question 1

In questions/q1.py, edit the function so that it returns the max element of an input list, or `None` if the input list is empty.

You can manually test your solution with `python -m unittest test.test_q1`.

### Question 2

In questions/q2.py, edit the function `get_most_common_char` so that it works as expected. You might find the
[python string documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/string.html) helpful.

You can manually test your solution with `python -m unittest test.test_q2`.
